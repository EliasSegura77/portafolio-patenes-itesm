160,143-341-656-059-306,METHOD FOR OBTAINING AN AG-CU-BASED SUPER PLASTIC MATERIAL FOR ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS AND OF SUPERPLASTIC ASSEMBLY.,"The present invention refers to a process for manufacturing an Ag-Cu-based alloy, in which different compositions were performed varying the melting temperature so as to obtain three different facets: hypereutectic, eutectic and hypoeutectic, which were analysed according to their mechanical properties for determining the application thereof. The three different compositions were hot rolled for providing them a mechanical property known as super plasticity, this property adding elastic properties to the material, i.e., the material may be elongated without affecting the mechanical properties thereof; the mechanical, resistance and hardness properties were subsequently analysed for validating the durability thereof. The advantages of the alloy resulting from the hot roll process are that recesses are not formed upon machining a geometry, necks are not formed upon elongating the material and notches in the surface are not grown with deformation. It is important to mention that silver is an excellent electricity conductor, but it is quite expensive, consequently being alloyed with copper, which has excellent heat dissipation and conduction properties. The alloy of these two metals preserves the electric and thermal properties of both metals, silver improving said properties. Copper improves the hardness of the alloy and turns it into less susceptible to corrosion and oxidation. The alloy may be applied in the manufacture of terminals of electronic components, this turning the electron transference into more efficient; it is important to consider that the use of copper turns the heat dissipation into more efficient, the superplastic property turning the terminals into more elastic and harder, thus being easily manipulated, ensuring the correct connection of the terminals to other electronic components, and reducing the interaction time thereof. The invention may also be applied in the metal mechanical industry, since the use of sheets allows different geometries to be obtained by the superplastic process, therefore considerably reducing machinery costs and manufacturing processes.",CASOLCO SAID ROBLES;;ALARCON ADRIANNI ZANATTA;;ALVAREZ DANIEL JIMENEZ;;CUAPIO ALAN FLORES;;ROJAS ALBERTO DAVID VILLALVA;;CORDERO FRANCISCO MANUEL LOSADA;;MANZANO OMAR CASTRO
